# enron
    Machine Learning Project â€” Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.

    Using all the concepts and ideas learned through the Introduction to Machine Learning module within the Udacity's Data Analyst NanoDegree, this project will use the scikit-learn Python library and machine learning techniques to predict and spot culpable persons of the Enron scandal.

    All the project questions are answered directly in the enron.pdf.

    The final structure of the code is the following:
    poi_id.py: main script.
    poi_explore.py: contains all the functions related to the data exploration
    poi_feature_chose.py: contains all the functions related to the feature selection
    poi_id_DiecisionTreeClassifier:try different algorithms.
    poi_id_SVC:try different algorithms.
    poi_id_new_features.py:try to use new features.
    tester.py: script used to test the algorithm performance.


#Project Overview

    In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives. In this project, you will play detective, and put your new skills to use by building a person of interest identifier based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal. To assist you in your detective work, we've combined this data with a hand-generated list of persons of interest in the fraud case, which means individuals who were indicted, reached a settlement or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity.
